Making stuff is hard.

I started this blog because I have a lot of ideas that end up sitting in my head and I want to record them somewhere. Unfortunately the act of organizing my thoughts into the written format takes a lot of work and a surprising amount of time!

When you add up life responsibilities (work, family, daily routine) with writing a blog and trying to make an indie game, there just aren't enough hours in the day to write the detailed blog posts that I was aiming for at the start.

Going forward, I'm hoping to write one blog post per month and keep it short and sweet.

With the extra time, my efforts are going to be redirected towards making more games. I enjoy writing games "from scratch" and my goal is to release a commercial game next year. I want to keep the game scoped as small as possible with a tight core game loop.

I wish you a happy new year, good health, and success in your ambitions!
